# Ansible v.2.12.10
Ansible is an open-source configuration management and automation tool used to automate IT infrastructure. It uses a simple and easy-to-learn language called YAML to define automation tasks and configurations, and it is agentless, meaning that it does not require any software to be installed on the managed hosts.

Some of the basic concepts of Ansible include:

Inventory: The list of hosts that Ansible manages. This can be defined in a simple text file or in a dynamic inventory script that generates the inventory based on some external source like a cloud provider API.

Playbook: A YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be performed on one or more hosts. Playbooks are composed of one or more plays, and each play consists of a set of tasks that are executed on a specific set of hosts.

Task: A single action to be performed on a host, such as installing a package, copying a file, or running a command. Tasks are defined in a playbook and are executed in order.

Module: A unit of code that performs a specific action, such as managing packages, files, or users. Ansible comes with a large number of built-in modules, and you can also write your own custom modules.

Role: A collection of tasks, files, templates, and other resources that are organized together and can be reused across different playbooks.

To use Ansible, you need to install it on a control node, which can be any machine that has Python installed. You also need to have SSH access to the managed hosts, as Ansible uses SSH to connect to and manage the hosts.

Once you have Ansible installed and your inventory defined, you can start writing playbooks and running them using the ansible-playbook command. Ansible provides a lot of built-in functionality for common tasks like managing packages, files, and users, so you can get started with Ansible quickly and easily.
